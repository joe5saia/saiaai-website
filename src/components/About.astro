        PhD economist to engineering leader, still shipping the code.

        I specialize in healthcare and revenue cycle management, translating messy operations into
        clean systems, durable data, and teams that move fast without breaking trust.

      <p>
        I’ve led multi-disciplinary engineering orgs, rebuilt data platforms from scratch, and paired
        with finance leaders to make unit economics legible.
